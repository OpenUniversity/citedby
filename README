Linking of athor's records with citing records is done in the bibtex file:

@article{Sh:1,
author = {Shelah, Saharon},
ams-subject = {(02.50)},
journal = {Israel Journal of Mathematics},
review = {MR 40-7102},
pages = {187--202},
title = {Stable theories},
volume = {7},
year = {1969},
keywords={own},
usera={Sh:4, Sh:5, Sh:6}
},

@article{Sh:4,
author = {Shelah, Saharon},
ams-subject = {(02.50)},
journal = {Journal of Symbolic Logic},
review = {MR 44-52},
pages = {73--82},
title = {On theories $T$ categorical in $|T|$},
volume = {35},
year = {1970},
},

....

Author's records must have set its 'keywords' field to 'own', and in field 'usera', 
there is a list of citing publication's citekeys.
